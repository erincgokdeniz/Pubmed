The present study aimed to investigate whether the pedunculopontine projection to
the thalamus overlaps with identified thalamostriatal neurons. These projections 
were studied using a dual tract-tracing procedure combining anterogradely
transported biotinylated dextran amine (pedunculopontine projections) and
retrogradely transported Fluoro-Gold (thalamostriatal projections). Overlapping
thalamic territories between thalamostriatal neurons and the axon terminals
arising from the pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus were observed in the midline 
(paraventricular) and in the intralaminar (centrolateral, central medial,
paracentral and parafascicular) thalamic nuclei. Other thalamic nuclei, such as
the ethmoid, intermediodorsal, mediodorsal, paratenial, posteromedian,
ventromedian, ventrolateral and rhomboid thalamic nuclei, displayed a lesser
degree of overlap. These observations suggest the existence of presumptive
contacts between thalamostriatal neurons and axons emerging from the
pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus, therefore supporting the possible existence
of feedback circuits in the rat basal ganglia in which the tegmento-thalamic
projection would play a major role.
