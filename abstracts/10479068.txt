An investigation of the developmental expression of calretinin immunoreactivity
and mRNA expression was carried out in the developing mouse diencephalon.
Attention was focused on the thalamic eminence, which is a prominent structure
previously described in the thalamus of the fetal mammalian diencephalon and
adult lower vertebrates. Calretinin-positive staining was first observed in the
thalamic eminence beginning at embryonic day 11. In situ hybridization
histochemistry confirmed the presence of calretinin mRNA in the thalamic
eminence. During subsequent embryonic development calretinin expression was very 
intense in neurons in the thalamic eminence though embryonic day 17, and
thereafter, was increasingly difficult to distinguish. By postnatal day 0 the
thalamic eminence was no longer discernable. Additional neurons within the murine
diencephalon also expressed calretinin positive cell bodies and, or neuronal
processes, including the stria medullaris, the habenular commissure and the
paraventricular thalamic nucleus. It is possible that the thalamic eminence may
form during development in order to act as an organizing center for the
diencephalon.
